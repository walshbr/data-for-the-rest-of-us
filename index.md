Data science might feel like the domain of rarefied experts: computer scientists, engineers, or statisticians. But data is all around us: anytime you use your smartphone, log into a social media site, or listen to music online, you leave a slew of datasets in your wake. Data literacy can prepare you for a range of careers across industry, the cultural heritage sector, and more—all without ever touching a programming language. This course will equip students with the skills necessary to work with the full lifecycle of data: collection, description, organization, cleaning, analysis, and distribution. Methods and tools covered will include web scraping, metadata standards, Google Open Refine, qualitative analysis, Microsoft Power BI, and GitHub. No previous experience with programming or data analysis necessary. We’ll focus, especially, on working with data drawn from the humanities, which tends to be messy, understudied, and scarce.
