## Plan

* Work time to finalize the description of your shared data project. Focus on metadata schema. 

## Homework

* Send the full metadata schema and breakdown for the data you will be collecting for your project by Friday at 9:00AM. Describe in 50 words what sorts of decisions were necessary to come to in deciding on this schema. What stories will or will not be told?
