## Plan

* Scrum presentations
    * Three minutes max for each group onâ€¦
        * what you have done
        * what is next
        * what you need from someone else (your group members, me)
* Work time to finalize the description of your shared data project. Focus on metadata schema. 
* Brandon available for check-in's and questions

## Homework

* Send the full metadata schema and breakdown for the data you will be collecting for your project by Friday at 9:00AM. Describe in 200 words (or more if you need it) what sorts of decisions were necessary to come to in deciding on this schema? What stories will or will not be told? 
* Also submit 50 words about your individual contribution to the week's work.
