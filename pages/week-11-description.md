## Plan

* Work time to finalize the description of your shared data project. Focus on metadata schema. 
* Check-in's with Brandon for each group.

## Homework

* Send the full metadata schema and breakdown for the data you will be collecting for your project by Friday at 9:00AM. Describe in 100-150 words what sorts of decisions were necessary to come to in deciding on this schema. What stories will or will not be told? Also submit 50 words about your individual contribution to the week's work.
