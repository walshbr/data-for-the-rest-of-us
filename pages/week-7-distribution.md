## Homework

* As an individual, come up with three potential data sources to collect and hone into a final project. Email to me by 9:00 AM Friday. For each of them, share a link and a short description of it.
* Meet in your groups to discuss your potential project ideas. As a group,you will each you will pitch three potential ideas to a group of judges next time. This means you will have to select which ideas you will propose. 

And as a preview, your final outcome will entail the following, so you might want to touch on some pieces of this during your presentations.

* Collected, cleaned dataset
* Metadata breakdown
* Narrative of the dataset
* Usage examples
* Basic analysis
* Credits
