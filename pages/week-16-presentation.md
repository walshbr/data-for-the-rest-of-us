## Plan

* Final presentation of your dataset. Roughly 15 minutes for each group. Plan on walking through the various components of your final presentation.

## Final Project Description

Follow the steps of the course units to create a dataset and accompanying narrative. The outcome will look similar to the datasets shared on the [Post45 Data Collective](https://data.post45.org/) and [Responsible Datasets in Context](https://www.responsible-datasets-in-context.com/). Your final product should include:

* Collected, cleaned data
* Metadata breakdown
* Narrative of the dataset
* Usage examples, suggestions, and questions it raises
* Basic analysis
* Credits
* Licensing information

The resulting work will probably be around 5-7 pages altogether, and you have milestones to hit along the way to get you there.

## Homework

* Celebrate!
* Upload to Canvas an individual 200 word reflection on your group presentation, your finalized dataset, and your data narrative.
* Make sure you have your final project narrative and dataset uploaded to Canvas by the end of the week if possible.
