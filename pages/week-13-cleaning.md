## Plan

* Work time to begin cleaning your project with Google Open Refine.
* Check-in's with Brandon for each group.

## Homework

* Send the cleaned dataset along to me by Friday at 9:00AM. Describe any issues in 100-150 words. It's ok if you need more time! Also submit 50 words about your individual contribution to the week's work.
