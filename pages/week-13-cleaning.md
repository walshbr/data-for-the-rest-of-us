## Plan

* Scrum presentations
    * Three minutes max for each group onâ€¦
        * what you have done
        * what is next
        * what you need from someone else (your group members, me)
* Work time to begin cleaning your project with Google Open Refine.
* Brandon available for check-in's and questions

## Homework

* Send the cleaned dataset along to me by Friday at 9:00AM. Describe what you had to do to process the materials in 200 words. What decisions did you have to make? 
* Also submit 50 words about your individual contribution to the week's work.
