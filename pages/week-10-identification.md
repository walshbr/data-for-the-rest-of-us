## Plan

* Work time for identification of your shared data project and to develop a plan for how the work will go. 
* Check-in's with Brandon for each group.

## Homework

* Send your group's selected topic and planned dataset to me by Friday at 9:00 AM. As a group, describe in 100-150 words why it matters. Also submit 50 words about your individual contribution to the week's work.
