## Plan

* Scrum presentations
    * Three minutes max for each group onâ€¦
        * what you have done
        * what is next
        * what you need from someone else (your group members, me)
* Work time for identification of your shared data project and to develop a plan for how the work will go. 
* Brandon available for check-in's and questions

## Homework

* Send your group's selected topic and planned dataset to me by Friday at 9:00 AM. As a group, describe in 200 words (or more if you need it) why it matters, where it comes from, how you will collect it.
* Also submit 200 words about your individual contribution to the week's work.
