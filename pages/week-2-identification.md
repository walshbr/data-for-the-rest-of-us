## Guiding Questions

* What counts?
* Where can you find it?
* How do you tell what is missing?

## Pre-work

* [Wikipedia Definition of Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data)
* Explore
    * [US Government's Open Data](https://data.gov/)
    * [Google Datasets](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
* [On Missing Data Sets](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets)

## Plan
* A definition
* What counts as data
    * Activity: Data or not?
* Where to find it
    * Activity: What don't you see?

## Homework
