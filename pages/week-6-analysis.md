## Guiding Questions

* How does all the work we have done so far enable us to ask new questions of our materials?
* How do quantitative and qualitative analyses relate to one another?

## Pre-work

* [Qualitative vs Quantitative Research](https://www.lyssna.com/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-research/)
* [Looker Studio Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Coe_f79Xc2o). Try to follow on your own.

## Plan

* Introduction: Qualitative vs Quantitative Analysis
* Activity: Workshop on Looker Studio
* [Slides linked here](/data-for-the-rest-of-us/resources/week-6/analysis.pptx)

## Homework

* Use Looker Studio to tell a story about the data. By 9:00 AM send me a paragraph describing what you see and a screenshot of any visualization that is meaningful to you.
* For your final project, come up with three potential data sources to collect and hone into a final project. Email to me by 9:00 AM Friday. For each of them, share a link, a short description, and some keywords describing your interests.
    * (Iâ€™m going to try to group you into like-minded subject areas)
* And as a preview, your final outcome will entail the following, so you might want to touch on some pieces of this during your presentations.
    * Collected, cleaned dataset
    * Data essay containing
        * Metadata breakdown
        * Narrative of the dataset
        * Usage examples
        * Basic analysis
        * Credits
        * Distributed to a repository (potentially!)
