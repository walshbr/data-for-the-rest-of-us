## Guiding Questions

* How does all the work we have done so far enable us to ask new questions of our materials?
* How do quantitative and qualitative analyses relate to one another?

## Pre-work

* [Qualitative vs Quantitative Research](https://www.lyssna.com/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-research/)
* [Looker Studio Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Coe_f79Xc2o). Try to follow on your own.

## Plan

* Introduction: Qualitative vs Quantitative Analysis
* Activity: Workshop on Looker Studio
* [Slides linked here](/resources/week-6/analysis.pptx)

## Homework

* Use looker studio to tell a story about the data. By 9:00 AM send me a paragraph describing what you see and a screenshot of any visualization that is meaningful to you.
