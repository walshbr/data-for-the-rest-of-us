## Guiding Questions

* What will you work on for the remainder of the course? 

## Pre-work

* Come prepared to present two potential final data sources for your final project. You'll be sharing them for a panel of judges to discuss as a group. 
* Answer these questions in your presentations:
    * What is the dataset? Why do we care?
    * How viable does it seem to collect the data? to clean it?
    * What questions might someone answer with the dataset that can't otherwise be answered?
    * Are there any concerns about doing this work on this data, ethical or legal?
    * What are the pro's and cons of each data source?
    * Which stories are you most interested in?

## Plan

* Student groups will pitch two potential ideas in groups to a panel of judges. 10 minutes max for each group followed by five minutes of Q&A.

## Homework

* Submit a short write-up of your group's ideas by Friday at 9:00AM. One single-spaced page max, so roughly one paragraph for each idea. Rank them based on your interest and how feasible they seem. If you have decided as a group on which is best, great. Otherwise Brandon will pick for you if you ask him to do so.
