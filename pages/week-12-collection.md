## Plan

* Scrum presentations
    * Three minutes max for each group onâ€¦
        * what you have done
        * what is next
        * what you need from someone else (your group members, me)
* Work time to plan for and then collect the data for your project using webscraper.io.
* Brandon available for check-in's and questions


## Homework

* Send the raw dataset along to Brandon by Friday at 9:00AM. Describe any issues in 200 words (or more if you need it). 
* Also submit 200 words about your individual contribution to the week's work.
