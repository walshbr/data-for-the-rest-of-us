## We Data: An Icebreaking Activity

I want to get to know you. In the spirit of the course, your job is to make a dataset about yourselves to share back with me. You have 45 minutes in which to do so. You have to hit the following buckets. 

* **Identify your data**
    * Who are you? 
* **Describe your data**
    * What are you interested in describing as a part of your dataset? What are you not?
* **Collect**
    * Gather your data in one place.
* **Clean**
    * Edit the dataset so that it's in a presentable, consistent format.
* **Analyze**
    * What stories are in your dataset?
* **Distribute**
    * How will you share it back to me?

**Some advice**

* Not everyone has to work on the same things! Divide up.
* Use what you have.
* Don't spend so much time talking. Do.

## Homework

* By Friday morning at 9:00 AM, share your class dataset with me.
