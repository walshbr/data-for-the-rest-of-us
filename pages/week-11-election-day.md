## Plan

No meeting because of election day but homework on "Description" still due by end of the week.

## Homework

* Send the full metadata schema and breakdown for the data you will be collecting for your project by Friday at 9:00AM. Describe in 200 words (or more if you need it) what sorts of decisions were necessary to come to in deciding on this schema? What stories will or will not be told? 
* Also submit 50 words about your individual contribution to the week's work.
