## Guiding Questions

* What is the importance of clean, tidy data?
* How do we fix problems with our data?

## Pre-work

* [Open Refine Documentation](https://openrefine.org/docs); install and work through each piece of the documentation, stopping after you finish the section on reconciling. 
* [Matt Lincoln on Tidy Data](https://pricelab.sas.upenn.edu/podcast/1/dream-lab-podcast-tidy-data)
* Download the Audible datasets for use in class. Taken from this [kaggle repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehangsude/audible-dataset?resource=download&select=audible_cleaned.csv) Leave them as zip files - don't uncompress them. Download links:
    * [Audible Uncleaned](/data-for-the-rest-of-us/resources/audible_uncleaned.csv (1).zip)
    * [Audible Cleaned](/data-for-the-rest-of-us/resources/audible_cleaned.csv (1).zip)
