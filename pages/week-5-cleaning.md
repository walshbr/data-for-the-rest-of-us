## Guiding Questions

* What is the importance of clean, tidy data?
* How do we fix problems with our data?

## Pre-work

* [Open Refine Documentation](https://openrefine.org/docs); work through each piece of the documentation, stopping after you finish the section on reconciling. 
* [Cleaning Data with Susan Walsh from the "Data Career Podcast"](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/33-cleaning-data-with-susan-walsh-the-classification-guru/id1547386535?i=1000543873861) TODO: listen to this to see if it's all useful
* Optional: ["Against Cleaning", Katie Rawson and Trevor Mu√±os](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.5749/j.ctvg251hk.26.pdf?acceptTC=true&coverpage=false)

## The Plan

* Share your job interview question
* What is cleaning and why does it matter
* Cleaning by hand
* Collection tied to cleaning - 
* Exercise in Google Open Refine

## Homework

* By Friday have them clean up a messed up dataset
