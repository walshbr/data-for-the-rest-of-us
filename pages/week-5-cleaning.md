## Guiding Questions

* What is the importance of clean, tidy data?

Look at [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehangsude/audible-dataset?resource=download&select=audible_cleaned.csv) of audiobook data. Compare the uncleaned version and the cleaned one. Then use Open Refine to get from one to the other. 

## Homework

* Work through [this lesson](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/cleaning-data-with-openrefine) on The Programming Historian. Send a screenshot of your successful results along by Friday at 9:00 AM.
