## Guiding Questions

* How do we describe data?
* What are metadata standards?

## Pre-work

* [Describing Data LibGuide](https://guides.lib.uci.edu/datamanagement/describe)
* [What are Metadata Standards?](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/briefing-papers/standards-watch-papers/what-are-metadata-standards)
* [Dublin Core Specifications](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) - you don't need to read this ahead of time but you'll need to have the link for class. 

## Plan

* Activity: Organizing and Describing
* [Slides linked here](/data-for-the-rest-of-us/resources/week-3/description.pptx)

## Homework

* Select a cultural interest (film, books, music) of yours and manually create a dataset from it. You should have at least 10 objects in your dataset with five metadata categories each. Be detailed and use Dublin Core as your metadata standard. Submit Friday by 9:00 AM.
