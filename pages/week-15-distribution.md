## Plan

* Scrum presentations
    * Three minutes max for each group onâ€¦
        * what you have done
        * what is next
        * what you need from someone else (your group members, me)
* Work time to develop and implement the distribution plan for your dataset.
* Brandon available for check-in's and questions

## Final Project Description

Follow the steps of the course units to create a dataset and accompanying narrative. The outcome will look similar to the datasets shared on the [Post45 Data Collective](https://data.post45.org/) and [Responsible Datasets in Context](https://www.responsible-datasets-in-context.com/). Your final product should include:

* Collected, cleaned data
* Metadata breakdown
* Narrative of the dataset
* Usage examples, suggestions, and questions it raises
* Basic analysis
* Credits
* Licensing information

The resulting work will probably be around 5-7 pages altogether, and you have milestones to hit along the way to get you there.

## Homework

* "Publish" your dataset and compiled documentation (all the different small components you have been working on) on Canvas by Friday at 9:00AM. Also submit 200 words about your individual contribution to the week's work.
* This might involve uploading your work to [Dataverse](https://dataverse.lib.virginia.edu/), sharing back with the groups who own your data, or deciding not to distribute. If you have concerns, talk to Brandon.
