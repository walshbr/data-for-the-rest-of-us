Each group has been told they will get about 15 minutes, with 10 minutes for the presentation and 5 minutes for responses from you all. They will be presenting two project ideas each.

My hope is that you will help provide feedback to shape the ideas into workable and exciting options for a final project: . | Which idea seems more doable or exciting? | Are there major red flags or ethical concerns? | Does it seem well scoped? | If too big or small, can you provide thoughts to scope it in either direction? | Are there technical limitations the students need to watch out for? Any other thoughts? | Of the two ideas, which one seems better given all this? | . If you’re more of a rubric person, I might go with two categories and rank them out of 10: . | Doable | Valuable | .
